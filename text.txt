Q.1. B.
Design Principles
should not suffer from Tunnel vision-
It should not reflect like it changing: the
requirement when designing.
2. Traceable to Model Analysis
changes made must be traced in order to
maintain quality
3. Should not reinvent the wheel
& Multiples things are available at & for free
so we should not build it ourselves.
worant communMinimize Intellectual distance
Designing should express the working of
the softwo are
Exibnit Uniformity & Integration
Uniformity and Integration should be done
-properly in order for proper function.
6. Accomodate changes
9.
should be able to made changes
7. Degrade Gracefully
Should degrade with time without causing
any breaking to the softs ares.
B. Assened or Quality
Quality must be maintained throughout
The process
in future
Review
for errors
continous reviewing will help in finding
errors
10. Design is not coding, coding is not design.
Design means the UI/Ux, it does not mean
programming part.

Q.2. B.
Software Maintainence
quality, code read
Maintaining a softwares quality
abuity; managing deployment etc is essen
tial for organizations.
• Maintenance helps in following things -
• Helps in adding new features
• Helps in refactoring the code base
• usual updates & patches
• Helps in reducing time y effort
• Provide profit to the company
• Helps building the legacy system in
proper manner
• Maintaining is must in order to keep making
changes.
• Maintainence involves programming knowle
dge.
• Writing clean, managable y readable code
is essential for maintaining code bases
Re-engineering
• Re-engineering is a process in which old
or existing system are refered to build
a new thing

Q.3. A. RIMM
• It stands for pisk mitigation monitoring and
Management
• It is use to prevent control and manage
the risks that occurs conic developing a
project
analyzing
• It is very helpful for analyzing the risk of
a project and to eliminate it.
RMMM involves a for formal document for the
implementation but RIS sheet is widely
used instead
RISK-ID: 1001 Date: 19/10/23
Probablity: 504.
Description codebase broke while making the
feature of autoplay.
context -
1. changed the whole layout of the app.
2. Introduced some bugs related to
video player
Mitigation/Monitoring -
1. Lonile monitoring we found that it
occurred due to wrong function call
Management -
1. For now, shift to previous version
2. Quickly patch the bug
Name - Ashish
Step - Management started.•RMMM involves three phones, mitigation, manito
ring and management.
• In the mitigat
Mitigation
• Involves preventive measures Ag to reduce
The chances of risk.
• Done at the earliest stages
• It involves functions like keeping the
code base up to dated, my proper integrati
on etc.
G
Monitoring -
• In this phase, risk is monitored.
• Behaivour of the risk is monitored in or
der to maintain the risk history.
• It helps in identify in g. what is happening
due to the risk.
Management
• Last step of RMMM
• After the risk is monitored, managing of
that risk starts
• Completely eliminating the risk is the a4
aim of this phase.
Q.3. C.
Version control
• Managing the codebase in terms of versions
is called as version control.
• version control helps in keeping the track of
changes made through different version.
• It helps in adding new features to the
codebane or help maintaining the codebase.
• It provides collaboration of team work
for developers.
• It mainly involves of -
1. Repository (code base / folder) in which
all the files are going to be tracked.
2. commits - changes which are committed
, are made permanent in the repository.
- Helps in working in team
and contributing to open softwares.
3. collaboration -
• softio are industries uses version control
in order to track the project
• Softwares like Git, GitHub etc provides
this functionality.
• Branches are used to add new features
