IT and OT Responsibilities in IOT Reference Model:
1. In the figure below, we can see that the IT and
OT Responsibilities in IoT Reference Model are
shown in the form of a stack of many layers.
2. The upper layers of the stack represent the
I work that IT does with respect to the newer IoT
systems.
3. The lower layers represent the responsibilities
of OT with respect to the system.
4. Earlier, IT mainly deals with storing, analysing,
cleaning and processing the data that is collected.
5. The collection of data, on the other hand, is
done by physical devices and sensors present
out in the environment.⑦Collection and.

6. The model is divided into seven layers, all of
various purposes.
7. The 1st layer collects all the data, in
real-time, from the physical environment.
8. The second layer connects the physical layer
to the internet.
9. Since, the data that is being collected can be
extremely huge in quantity, it is temporarily
stored and then slowly small quantities of
data is sendt to the IT layers.
10. This is done because the real-time data is
huge and the processors and servers at the
IT end would not be able to take that
amount of load.
11. This is why the OT end of the stack has
data in motion and the IT end has data TA
at rest.
eg.
12. After the data is sent received by the
servers, it is analysed. For 1 A weather
sensory sends the #wco current weather
conditions to the server
+
in turn the
server processes the data and uses it
to make a weather forecasting application.Q3A

RFID:
1. RFID refers to Radio Frequency Identification.
2. It consists of a tag that is
of an integrated circuit and
made up
an antenna.
3. Another important module of the system is
the reader.
4. The tag (also known as transponder) is
attached to the object that is being identified.
5. The reader queries the tag be by sending
Radio Frequency (RF) waves to identify it.
6. RFIDs are made using multiple frequencies,
namely; low frequency, high frequency,
ultra high frequency, microwaves frequency, etc
7. Low frequency (LF) RFIDS were deployed
first for high-value, short-range industrial
appliances and car immobilizer.
8. Low frequency REID, have low data ranges
and low data rates.
9. High frequency RFIDs have high data rates
and longer data ranges.
10. Ultra High frequency RFIDs have even higher
data = ranges and data rates but they cannot
be used near metallic objects, water and
human bodies.
11. Principle of RFID:
voltage
A copper coll of is attached to a power sources
and due to the impedance it experiences,
a voltage is developed accross its terminals.
We can attach a capacitor parallel to this
coil to increase its voltage. We will call
this the primary coil. Now, we bring another
copper coil near the primary coll. This is the
secondary coil. The secondary coil experiences.
an emf from the primary coill and hence,
a voltage developed accross its terminals.
We connect a load resistor to thesecondary coil and current starts
I to flow in the secondary coil. This
flow of current results in the primary
coll experiencing a back emf
(electromotive
force). This is how wt we can see
find what device is attached to the
secondary coll, by measuring the voltage
across the primary coil.

12. Applications of RFID in IOT !
a) Fast Tags.
: Government uses RFIDs to attached
to cars in order to pay tolls, instead
of the old way by stopping
b) Libraries : Books are attached with RFIDS
to make it easier to keep and inventory
e of books and to find their information
easily.
c) Identification & Tracking: RFIDs can be
attached to animals in order to keep
track of them.

A smart object is an object that can
all the jobs like collecting data, performing
actions, storing data, communicating with
other devices, etc.
2. A smart object consists of a the
following:
eg:
а
a) Sensors :- These help in collecting data
from the object's environments. For
sensor for an automated car would be
the odometer, etc
b) Actuators 1- These perform physical tasks
that they are instructed to do.
c) Communication devices :- These communicate
with other devices to get instructions and
send data.
d) Power Supply:- This is to supply power
for performing all the tasks.Q1A

Security as a driver behind network
architecture.
1. Security is a non-negotiable part
of any IT infrastructure..
2. Security experts go to great lengths
to keep their systems, servers and
networks secure from malicious
attacks.
3. But in case of IoT devices, security
poses a great threat.
4. This is because the IoT devices not
only require virtual security but also
physical security as the sensors, etc) are
present out in the environment.+
